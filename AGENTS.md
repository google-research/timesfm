# TimesFM — Agent Entry Point

This repository ships a first-party **Agent Skill** for TimesFM at:

```
timesfm-forecasting/
└── SKILL.md    ← read this for the full skill
```

## Install the skill

Copy the skill directory into your agent's skills folder:

```bash
# Cursor / Claude Code / OpenCode / Codex (global install)
cp -r timesfm-forecasting/ ~/.cursor/skills/
cp -r timesfm-forecasting/ ~/.claude/skills/

# Or project-level
cp -r timesfm-forecasting/ .cursor/skills/
```

Any agent that supports the open [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io) will discover it automatically.

## Working in this repo

Archived v1/v2 code and notebooks are in `v1/`.
